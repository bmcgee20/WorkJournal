Work Journal Program Testing and Installation Instructions:

How to run the project:
	1) Open Eclispse (Java Version)
	2) File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace
		a) Set root directory to the project folder (It may require you to remove any projects with the same name from the open projects).
		b) Select the project
		c) Click finish
		d) Project folder should show up in the IDE
	3) Run the program from eclipse
		a) Code is in Project_4->src->(default package)->[class files here]
		b) Database referenced is in Project_4->src->JavaDB.db
	
Testing the Program:
	1) Just use the default login for testing
	2) Add an entry for the day after logging in
	3) View that entry and past entries under "View Entries"
	4) View data from those under the "View Data" button

Works of Warning: 
	1) After testing out the program with the default login feel free to make a new account and test the login.	
		The only reason I say to use the default is cause only one entry can be added per day so using the default
		login gives you more than one entry to view the charts on.
	2) Only one entry can be added a day per user.
	3) The reason I say to run it in eclipse is so you can use the database that already is filled with values for testing
		if it was in a jar it would make a new database and it would take a couple days of entries to be useful.
